# mobile-code-editor

This is an attempt at a web-based code editor for mobile devices that works well with largish files. It supports a different workflow than most editors. Here are the steps to editing some text:

* Select a line
* Select another line, to get a manageable range of text
* Edit the text using the mobile device's Text Area
